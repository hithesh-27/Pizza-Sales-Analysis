​🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis: End-to-End Data Analytics Project

​📜 Project Overview
​This project provides a comprehensive Pizza Sales Analysis, showcasing an end-to-end data analytics workflow. I leveraged various industry tools to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence. The workflow covers everything from initial data cleaning and transformation using Excel and SQL to advanced reporting and visualization using Power BI and Tableau.
​The main goal is to derive crucial insights from a year's worth of pizza sales data to help a business optimize operations, menu offerings, and marketing strategies for increased revenue and efficiency.

​⚙ Tech Stack & Tools
​This analysis utilized a powerful combination of tools for each stage of the data pipeline:
​Data Preparation: Microsoft Excel was used for initial data cleaning, inspection, and preparation, handling basic inconsistencies and formatting.
​Data Analysis & Querying: SQL (e.g., MySQL/SQL Server) was essential for complex Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL) tasks, calculating Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and performing sophisticated analytical queries.
​Business Intelligence: Power BI was used to create a highly interactive, dynamic dashboard, enabling deep-dive analysis and sophisticated stakeholder reporting.
​Data Visualization: Tableau was utilized to develop compelling, visually rich dashboards focused on uncovering significant sales trends and patterns.

​📊 Key Analysis & Insights
​The project calculated and visualized critical metrics to answer core business questions:
​Business Performance Metrics
​Total Revenue: The overall income generated from all sales.
​Total Orders: The total count of unique customer transactions.
​Average Order Value (AOV): The average monetary amount spent per transaction.
​Total Pizzas Sold: The total quantity of pizzas purchased by customers.

​Sales Trends and Segmentation
​Time-Series Analysis: Identification of peak sales hours, days, and months to optimize staffing and inventory.
​Category Performance: Analysis of sales breakdown by pizza category (e.g., Classic, Veggie, Supreme) and size.
​Product Performance: Determining the top and bottom 5-selling pizzas based on both revenue and quantity ordered.
​Contribution Analysis: Calculation of the percentage contribution of different pizza sizes and categories to total revenue.

​🛠 Workflow and Methodology
​The project followed a structured four-step methodology:
​Data Preparation: The raw sales data was first cleaned and prepared in Excel to ensure consistency and structure suitable for database loading.
​SQL ETL and Querying: The cleaned data was loaded into an SQL database. Complex queries involving joins, aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG), and grouping were written to transform the data and derive all the necessary KPIs.
​Power BI Dashboarding: The processed data was connected to Power BI. A comprehensive data model was built, and a multi-page interactive dashboard was created for executive-level reporting and detailed operational analysis.
​Tableau Visualization: A separate visual narrative was developed in Tableau to focus on clear, aesthetic, and impactful visual storytelling of key trends and comparisons.
